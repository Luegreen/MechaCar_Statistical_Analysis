The Intercept, ground_clearance and vehicle_length provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
Is the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the ocefficient if the Intercept has a p value of 5.08e-08 which is not zero.
This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes metzo-effectively because the Residual standard error is 8.774 on 44 degrees of Freedom. This is far from a perfect model.
